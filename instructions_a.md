# Instructions to build explorable explanations (webpages)

## Basic Understanding of explorable explanations

Explorable explanations are explanations intergrated with interactive examples. It is a written argument whose assertions are backed by explorable computational models, whose facts, assumptions, and calculations are all visible and editable.

Example 1:
The reactive document integrates spreadsheet-like models into authored text. It can be read at multiple levels, depending on the reader's level of interest. The hurried reader can skim it. The casual reader can read it as-is. The curious reader can adjust the author's scenarios. The engaged reader can explore scenarios of their own devising.

Example 2:
Interactive charts that allow readers to see how different parameters affect the results.

Example 3:
Contextual information that appears when you hover over a part of the text, or a minimal-search box that appears when you press certain keys.

An explorable example is a webpage that allows the user to interact with the content in order to understand it.

The user can interact with the content by clicking, dragging, and zooming. The content can be a chart, a graph, a table, or any other type of visualisation.

The user can also interact with the content by changing the parameters of the content. For example, the user can change the angle of a 3D graph by dragging on a slider.

  You can be wrong half the time and still be great at something. Action is always better than inaction.

  “The great investors bought vast quantities of art,” the firm writes.¹⁹ “A subset of the collections turned out to be great investments, and they were held for a sufficiently long period of time to allow the portfolio return to converge upon the return of the best elements in the portfolio. That’s all that happens.”

  Perhaps 99% of the works someone like Berggruen acquired in his life turned out to be of little value. But that doesn’t particularly matter if the other 1% turn out to be the work of someone like Picasso. Berggruen could be wrong most of the time and still end up stupendously right.

  Long tails—the farthest ends of a distribution of outcomes—have tremendous influence in finance, where a small number of events can account for the majority of outcomes. It means we underestimate how normal it is for a lot of things to fail. Which causes us to overreact when they do.

  Disney produced more than 400 cartoons in mid-1930s, most of them were short, beloved by viewers, and most of them lost a fortune. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs changed everything, it brought $8 million in revenue, which is an order of magnitude higher than anything the company earned previously.

  40% of Russell 3000 Index from J.P. Morgan Asset Management (collection of public companies since 1980) lost at least 70% of their value and never recovered over this period. Yet, The Russell 3000 has increased over 73-fold since 1980, because there are 7% of the components that performed extremely well that were more than enough to offset the damage.

  In 2018, Amazon drove 6% of the S&P 500’s returns. And Amazon’s growth is almost entirely due to Prime and Amazon Web Services, which itself are tail events in a company that has experimented with hundreds of products, from the Fire Phone to travel agencies.

  Apple was responsible for almost 7% of the index’s returns in 2018. And it is driven overwhelmingly by the iPhone, which in the world of tech products is as tail-y as tails get.

  Google’s hiring acceptance rate is 0.2%.²² Facebook’s is 0.1%.²³ Apple’s is about 2%.²⁴ So the people working on these tail projects that drive tail returns have tail careers.

  Most of your financial decision won’t matter as much as what you do during the small number of days—likely 1% or less—when everyone else around is going crazy. How you behaved as an investor during a few months in late 2008 and early 2009 will likely have more impact on your lifetime returns than everything you did from 2000 to 2008. Your success as an investor will be determined by how you respond to punctuated moments of terror, not the years spent on cruise control. 

  When you accept that tails drive everything in business, investing, and finance you realize that it’s normal for lots of things to go wrong, break, fail, and fall.

  Peter Lynch is one of the best investors of our time. “If you’re terrific in this business, you’re right six times out of 10,” he once said.

  Something I’ve learned from both investors and entrepreneurs is that no one makes good decisions all the time. The most impressive people are packed full of horrendous ideas that are often acted upon.

  Part of why this isn’t intuitive is because in most fields we only see the finished product, not the losses incurred that led to the tail-success product.

  “It’s not whether you’re right or wrong that’s important,” George Soros once said, “but how much money you make when you’re right and how much you lose when you’re wrong.” You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.

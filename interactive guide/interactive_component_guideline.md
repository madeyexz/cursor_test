# Guideline for Explorable Explanations

## Introduction

Explorable explanations are a powerful way to integrate interactive examples into written arguments. These explanations allow users to engage with the content by exploring computational models, making the underlying facts, assumptions, and calculations visible and editable.

## Key Components

1. **Interactive Models**: The core of explorable explanations is the interactive models that users can manipulate. These models should be intuitive and provide immediate feedback to the user's actions.

2. **Editable Parameters**: Allow users to change parameters and see the effects in real-time. This helps users understand the relationship between different variables and the overall system.

3. **Clear Visualizations**: Use charts, graphs, and other visual aids to represent data and model outputs. Visualizations should be clear, informative, and update dynamically as users interact with the model.

4. **Contextual Information**: Provide additional information and explanations that appear when users hover over or click on certain elements. This helps users understand the significance of different parts of the model.

5. **Guided Exploration**: Offer step-by-step instructions or guided tours to help users navigate through the explanation. This can include highlighting important features and suggesting interesting scenarios to explore.

## Best Practices

- **Simplicity**: Keep the interface simple and user-friendly. Avoid overwhelming users with too many options or complex controls.
- **Responsiveness**: Ensure that the interactive elements are responsive and work well on different devices and screen sizes.
- **Accessibility**: Make the explorable explanations accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use appropriate ARIA roles and ensure keyboard navigability.
- **Performance**: Optimize the performance of the interactive models to provide a smooth and responsive experience. Avoid long loading times and laggy interactions.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation and help resources to assist users in understanding and using the explorable explanations effectively.

## Examples

1. **Interactive Charts**: Create charts that allow users to adjust parameters and see how the results change. For example, an investment growth chart where users can change the initial investment, annual return rate, and investment duration.

2. **Reactive Documents**: Integrate spreadsheet-like models into authored text, allowing users to adjust scenarios and see the impact on the results. This can be used for financial projections, scientific simulations, and more.

3. **Contextual Tooltips**: Add tooltips that provide additional information when users hover over certain elements. This can include definitions, explanations, and links to related resources.

## Conclusion

Explorable explanations are a powerful tool for making complex information more accessible and engaging. By integrating interactive models, editable parameters, and clear visualizations, you can create compelling explanations that help users understand and explore the underlying concepts.

## Steps to Create Explorable Explanations

1. **Identify the Concept**: Determine the concept or topic you want to explain. Ensure it is suitable for interactive exploration and has underlying data or models that can be manipulated.

2. **Design the Interactive Model**: Create an interactive model that represents the concept. Ensure it is intuitive and provides immediate feedback to user interactions.

3. **Define Editable Parameters**: Identify the key parameters that users can change. Ensure these parameters have a significant impact on the model's output and help illustrate the concept.

4. **Develop Clear Visualizations**: Create visualizations such as charts, graphs, or tables to represent the model's output. Ensure these visualizations update dynamically as users interact with the model.

5. **Add Contextual Information**: Provide additional information and explanations that appear when users hover over or click on certain elements. This helps users understand the significance of different parts of the model.

6. **Implement Guided Exploration**: Offer step-by-step instructions or guided tours to help users navigate through the explanation. Highlight important features and suggest interesting scenarios to explore.

7. **Test for Usability**: Test the explorable explanation with real users to ensure it is intuitive, engaging, and informative. Gather feedback and make necessary improvements.

8. **Optimize Performance**: Ensure the interactive elements are responsive and perform well on different devices and screen sizes. Optimize loading times and interactions for a smooth user experience.

9. **Ensure Accessibility**: Make the explorable explanation accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Use appropriate ARIA roles and ensure keyboard navigability.

10. **Provide Documentation**: Offer clear documentation and help resources to assist users in understanding and using the explorable explanation effectively.

11. **Monitor and Iterate**: After deployment, monitor user interactions and gather feedback. Continuously iterate and improve the explorable explanation based on user feedback and new insights.

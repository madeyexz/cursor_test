# Instructions to build explorable explanations (webpages)

## Basic Understanding of explorable explanations

Explorable explanations are explanations intergrated with interactive examples. It is a written argument whose assertions are backed by explorable computational models, whose facts, assumptions, and calculations are all visible and editable.

Example 1:
The reactive document integrates spreadsheet-like models into authored text. It can be read at multiple levels, depending on the reader's level of interest. The hurried reader can skim it. The casual reader can read it as-is. The curious reader can adjust the author's scenarios. The engaged reader can explore scenarios of their own devising.

Example 2:
Interactive charts that allow readers to see how different parameters affect the results.

Example 3:
Contextual information that appears when you hover over a part of the text, or a minimal-search box that appears when you press certain keys.

An explorable example is a webpage that allows the user to interact with the content in order to understand it.

The user can interact with the content by clicking, dragging, and zooming. The content can be a chart, a graph, a table, or any other type of visualisation.

The user can also interact with the content by changing the parameters of the content. For example, the user can change the angle of a 3D graph by dragging on a slider.

## Requirements
- The point you will make is:
  - "Good investing isn’t necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can’t be repeated. It’s about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That’s when compounding runs wild."
- You will make this explanation explorable:
  Had Warren Buffett been an above-average Joe, he would start investing with $25,000 in his 30s and retire at age 60, so even tho he can generate 22% annually, he would end up with only 11.9M instead of the 84.5B he has now.

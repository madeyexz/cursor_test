General Debug Flow

1. Identify the problem
- Understand the issue by gathering information from error messages, logs, and user reports.
- Reproduce the problem to see it firsthand and confirm its existence.

2. Isolate the source
- Narrow down the code or component where the issue is occurring.
- Use debugging tools, such as breakpoints and step-through debugging, to inspect the code execution.

3. Analyze the code
- Review the relevant code to understand its logic and flow.
- Check for common issues such as syntax errors, incorrect logic, or missing edge cases.

4. Hypothesize a solution
- Based on the analysis, come up with potential solutions to fix the issue.
- Consider different approaches and choose the most appropriate one.

5. Implement the fix
- Apply the chosen solution to the code.
- Ensure that the fix addresses the root cause of the problem and does not introduce new issues.

6. Test the fix
- Verify that the issue is resolved by running tests and reproducing the original problem scenario.
- Perform regression testing to ensure that the fix does not affect other parts of the system.

7. Review and refactor
- Review the changes to ensure they follow best practices and coding standards.
- Refactor the code if necessary to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.

8. Document the solution
- Document the issue, the analysis, the solution, and any relevant information for future reference.
- Update any related documentation, such as user guides or technical manuals.

9. Monitor the system
- After deploying the fix, monitor the system to ensure that the issue does not reoccur.
- Gather feedback from users and logs to confirm the stability of the solution.
